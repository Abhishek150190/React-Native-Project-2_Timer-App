# React-Native-Project-2_Timer-App
App to measure dexterity in people  suffering from Parkinsonâ€™s disease 

There are 4parts of the UI. 
1.Title
2.Time Indicator
3.Tap counter
4.2 Tappable buttons
The time allotted for a user to complete this activity is 5 seconds. 
Time indicator should show the elapsed time
A user should be able to tap the buttons  provided in the lower section of the screen. 
Once 5 seconds are over, the app should not allow the user to register the taps.
The number of taps should always be upfront and visible to the user 


Generally it is done for 60 seconds but I have here set the limit to 5 seconds.
